Files to focus on
  ascii.c (returned buf; arrayptr vs nt_arrayptr)
  hash.c (void*)
  ipaddrparse.c (buffer checked, NT vs. not)
  ptracesandbox (header at least)
  session.h : the SSL state has void* --- how to fix this?
  ssl.h : same issue with void*
  netstr.h : checked function pointer type
  strlist.h : the nodes field is a normal pointer; should be an array?
  sysutil.h : at least get checked prototypes (e.g., with iface)
  
Not sure that NT_array --> array is working with off-by-one
errors. See die2 in utility.c. Make counterexample.

change to using checked standard library headers (e.g., stdio_checked)

make headers all checked
make individual functions checked, if need be

hunt for (char *) and (const char *) and start to remove them

ssl.c
netfd, readfunc writefunc stuff
standalone.c â€” ip_count 

make checked version of stat, other standard libraries

finish tunables.c (other arrays)
