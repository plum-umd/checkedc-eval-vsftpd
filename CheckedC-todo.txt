make headers all checked
make individual functions checked, if need be

hunt for (char *) and (const char *) and start to remove them

netfd, readfunc writefunc stuff
secbuf
netstr
ipsddrparse — use arrayptr
standalone.c — ip_count 

polymorphism where useful/applicable

make checked version of stat, other standard libraries

finish str.c (fewer assumptions)
finish tunables.c (other arrays)
