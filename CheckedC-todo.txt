str.c library:  getbuf and getlen: change types. getbuf should always
  return a NT array?

How to convert NT_array_ptr : count(n) to an array_ptr : count(n) ?
Useful in several places

Drop count(0) in most places, since it's (now) the default.

Some occasions we want to conver array_ptr to nt_array_ptr (in
str.c). Also times when we want to convert the other way. How to do
this? 

change to using checked standard library headers (e.g., stdio_checked)

make headers all checked
make individual functions checked, if need be

hunt for (char *) and (const char *) and start to remove them

ssl.c
netfd, readfunc writefunc stuff
secbuf
netstr
ipsddrparse — use arrayptr
standalone.c — ip_count 

polymorphism where useful/applicable

make checked version of stat, other standard libraries

finish tunables.c (other arrays)
