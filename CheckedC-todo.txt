Some occasions we want to conver array_ptr to nt_array_ptr (in
str.c). Also times when we want to convert the other way. How to do
this? 

make headers all checked
make individual functions checked, if need be

hunt for (char *) and (const char *) and start to remove them

netfd, readfunc writefunc stuff
secbuf
netstr
ipsddrparse — use arrayptr
standalone.c — ip_count 

polymorphism where useful/applicable

make checked version of stat, other standard libraries

finish str.c (fewer assumptions)
finish tunables.c (other arrays)
