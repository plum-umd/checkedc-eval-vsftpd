Not sure that NT_array --> array is working with off-by-one
errors. See die2 in utility.c. Make counterexample.

change to using checked standard library headers (e.g., stdio_checked)

make headers all checked
make individual functions checked, if need be

hunt for (char *) and (const char *) and start to remove them

ssl.c
netfd, readfunc writefunc stuff
secbuf
ipsddrparse — use arrayptr
standalone.c — ip_count 

polymorphism where useful/applicable

make checked version of stat, other standard libraries

finish tunables.c (other arrays)
