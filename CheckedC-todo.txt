Files to focus on
  ascii.c (returned buf; arrayptr vs nt_arrayptr)
  ptracesandbox (header at least)
  strlist.h : the nodes field is a normal pointer; should be an array?
  sysutil.h : at least get checked prototypes (e.g., with iface)
  postlogin.c : sighandlers, void*, ipv6 vs. v4 addr handling needs to
    be refactored

change str.c to make getlen and getbuf into macros so we can track
length relationships

make headers all checked
- ascii.h
- ptracesandbox.h
- sysutil.h

ipaddrparse.c (squirrely cast in unchecked code)
make checked version of sys/stat, fix signal_checked to define
 sa_handler so I don't have to do
     sigact.sa_handler = (void (*)(int))p_handlefunc;

NT notes:

Nt_array_ptr<char> buf : count(size) means that buf[size] == '\0’

array_ptr<T> p : bounds(lower, upper) :-  lower <= p' < upper // for all reads and writes via any pointer p’ based off p
array_ptr<T> p : count(n) :- p <= p’ < p + n // for all reads and writes via any pointer p’ based off p

nt_array_ptr<T> s : bounds(lower, upper) :- lower <= s’ < upper // for all writes via any pointer s’ based off s
nt_array_ptr<T> s : bounds(lower, upper) :- lower <= s’ <= upper // for all reads via any pointer s’ based off s
nt_array_ptr<T> s : count(n) :- s <= s’ < s + n // for all reads via any pointer s’ based off s.
nt_array_ptr<T> s : count(n) :- s <= s’ <= s + n // for all writes via any pointer s’ based off s.
